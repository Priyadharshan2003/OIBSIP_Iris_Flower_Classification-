# OIBSIP_Iris_Flower_Classification-
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the Iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them. 

This is a dataset called "Iris dataset". It consists of 150 rows and 6 columns. The first 5 columns contain measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of three different species of iris flowers. The last column contains the species of the iris. There are 50 observations for each of the three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
This dataset is often used in machine learning and data science for tasks such as classification and clustering.
